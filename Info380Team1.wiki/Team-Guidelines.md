**GOALS, EXPECTATIONS, STRATEGIES, RULES & CONSEQUENCES:**


**GOALS:** What are our group’s goals for how we accomplish our work?

- Shared project, meaning a project that everyone agrees to do rather than just a project that one group member wants
- Gaining a fundamental understanding of product management
- Produce a good final assignment/presentation as a result of the quarter long group project 
- enhance communication skills with stakeholders
- Be thoughtful of everyone’s inputs and try to incorporate everyone’s ideas

**EXPECTATIONS**: What do we expect of one another regarding attendance at meetings, participation, frequency of communication, the quality of work, etc.? Include contact information and preferred method(s) of communication.

- Finishing deliverables before the due date so there is some wiggle room in fixing issues.
- Be inclusive of all team members’ ideas 
- Doing all the required reading so that we engage with material without being leftout
- All be present to all lectures and sections or give a heads up at least 24 hours in advance
- Everyone should be engaged with in-class activities, assignments, and project material 
- One hour has been set aside on Tuesday's and Friday's but times can be changed throughout the quarter based on the team and workload 

**STRATEGIES**: What strategies can we employ to promote systems thinking, a suspension of assumptions, viewing one another as colleagues, and developing facilitation skills by all team members? What methods of giving and receiving feedback will best support us?

- Make sure to ask as many questions as needed about various topics
- If we disagree on something, hear each member out before making any final calls
- Making sure to divide work equally amongst group members
- If work is done separately, every team member should complete their part 24 hours before the deadline to allow 12 hours for feedback and 12 hours to make final changes
- If work is done separately, double check it before submission so each member is involved in every part 
- If a member has a question for the teaching team, they should update the team on what they are asking and what response they got so everyone is on the same page 

**TEAM RULES**: What rules can we agree on to help us meet our goals and expectations? (Tip: Be as specific as possible! E.g., if you agree to meet weekly at a certain time, what should team members do if a scheduling emergency arises? Do you want to always complete team assignments at least 48 hours in advance to allow time for review and editing?)

- 24 hour heads up if you’re missing class 
- 6 hour response time on replying on messages
- Don't be afraid to ask questions to TAs, Professor, and team members
- CC all team members on emails to TA’s or professor if related to group project
- Do required reading before lectures
- Give feedback at least 12 hours before due date if work is split between team members to allow time for changes 
- Turn in all group projects/assignments at least 1 hour before deadline

**CONSEQUENCES**: How will we address non-performance in regard to these goals, expectations, policies, and procedures? 
Note. It is possible that a member of the team can be removed by the other members of the team. Read more about the Team Warning and Removal Process.

- When a team member shows less work/lower quality in the assignments we would give them a verbal warning.
- If they continue to put low quality work throughout the quarter we would speak to the teaching team and file a team warning with the instructor.
- If the team member continues to not change behaviors after warnings and greatly affects our ability to make deadlines, we would start the removal process based on a majority vote from the team. 

*Exceptions will be made for emergencies, but make sure to contact team and teaching staff as soon as possible


We share these goals and expectations and agree to these policies, procedures, and consequences.
