**Satellite imagery**

The satellite imagery wireframe displays supported areas for monitoring IUU fishing. The map displays hot fishing zones while also monitoring fishing ships. The map also displays the ships based on their total IUU indicators, which means we can monitor high-risk ships. We can also filter by ship information whether that be length, capacity, etc, this allows authorities to search for specific ships. We can also see where the last alerts showed up, letting law enforcement know if there is a connection between these IUU fishing and to stay vigilant in these areas. If the user inputs the long and lat of a location they can quickly access it without having to drag to that location.
