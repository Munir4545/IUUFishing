**Page to report IUU fishing**

This page allows users to create and submit a new incident report about illegal fishing activities that they may have witnessed. It asks for specific details about the vessel involved, information about when the incident was witnessed, and information about the person submitting the incident form.
The forms submitted on this page will go through a filtering process which runs a check on the witness using their ID number to make sure all data is reliable.
