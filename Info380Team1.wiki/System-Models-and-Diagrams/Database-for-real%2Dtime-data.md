**Database for real-time data**


The proposed feature in this wireframe allows the users to access real time IUU fishing activity data as it’s being tracked by the satellite system and automatically input into the tracking system’s database every 3 milliseconds. This meets the Chief Sustainability Officer, Chief Prosecutor, Data Analyst and JV System Admin’s specific need for real-time data analytics and reporting. This feature also meets the JV System Admin’s need of being able to **export data** to various file formats with the export data button. Once clicked, it will give the user an option to export selected data values to file types such as Excel, CSV, text format, XML, and others that the stakeholders deem necessary for their reports. With the modify records button, the users can modify, add, or delete data values. This functionality should only be available to the System Admin and Data Analyst, which is confirmed by the text content above the button displaying the user’s name and role. If they are not an authorized user, they should not be able to access this database, which will ensure data security because of **role-based access** to data because it limits unnecessary access and modification. With the build report button, users must select data values that they want to include in the **report**, or they could select all on the page, and will be directed to the Reports page to create IUU fishing activity reports.
