**Real-time incident**

The system allows internal and external users to file reports about IUU activities that they were witnesses of. Once a new report is created, it is sent to analysts to verify the background of the user, as well as to verify the information provided on the form. Admin runs a thorough check to make sure all data is accurate so no wrong actions are taken. Once the analysts complete the analysis of the report, it is sent to the prosecutors to make a final decision on legal actions that should be taken against the involved parties.
