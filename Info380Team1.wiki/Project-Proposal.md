# **Executive Summary**

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) is a considerable threat to global food security because of its impact on the fishing industry and sustainable fishing practices, and damage to ecosystems. Ocean Guardians United, a joint venture, seeks to develop and implement a system that utilizes ship-tracking data, satellite imagery, and drone surveillance to track and report IUU fishing. The benefits of this system include enhanced monitoring capabilities, historical data for analyzing patterns, and real-time information breakdowns to stakeholders to enable prompt action against culprits of detected illegal fishing activities. This project also aims to enhance organizational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and potentially boost revenue. The main features include robust security measures, user-friendly interfaces, and comprehensive reporting options geared toward achieving these objectives. Key risks associated with the project include unauthorized access to data and limited maintainability and sustainability due to the complexity and scope of the system. We would mitigate these risks by implementing security measures to protect the data, requiring stakeholders to train users, and using eco-friendly materials and data collection methods. Assumptions of this system include an emphasis on robust infrastructure and technology, development of features by knowledgeable engineers with access to the current technology, and substantial budget allocation. 

# **Current State**

Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) is one of the biggest threats to the sustainability of the fishing industry. (Pew Charitable Trust, 2023) states that illegal fishing accounts for at least 1 in 5 fish caught, and this ends up costing coastal nations an estimated $10 to $25 billion dollars a year. (Schiffman, R., Robbins, J., & Gardiner, B., 2024) also stated that 75% of all fishing vessels go untracked, in which many IUU fishing vessels turn off their transponders. This huge amount of IUU fishing puts a strain on the ecosystem, as a portion of those illegal fishing vessels might fish in protected areas. Even though the majority of IUU fishing is in Asia, it is a global problem as IUU fishing puts a strain on global food security, economic security, and law abiding fishermen or fishing companies (Fisheries). As IUU fishing continues, there exists a need for a system that globally and consistently identifies and tracks IUU fishing (The Pew Charitable Trust, 2017).

To address these issues, a joint venture was established in 2020 named Oceans Guardian United (OGU). Comprising of nonprofit organizations and fishing companies, OGU's goal is to eliminate IUU fishing. Currently, OGU has many systems focused on reducing IUU fishing, but three systems are firmly targeted at reducing IUU fishing. 

Firstly, the Vessel Database, which stores fishing vessel information. This system is continuously updated by collaborating with other parties, but this database does not store information about ship movement and cannot be used to track ships doing IUU fishing. 

Secondly, the RFID System, in which fish are tagged and tracked until they hit the market, lets OGU know the legitimacy of the fishing activity. This system is very effective in determining products of IUU fishing, but the effectiveness of RFID relies on widespread adoption; if only certain regions adopt it, there could exist gaps in coverage. 

Lastly, OGU has a Fish Stock Management System, this system aims on tracking the stock of fishes in real-time, using data sources like fishery observers, fishing logs, and underwater sonars. Similar to the RFID system, the effectiveness of this system can be questioned depending on what areas receive coverage, as areas with limited infrastructure may be prone to little or no coverage. Each of these systems play an important role in supporting OGU's mission to reduce and eliminate IUU fishing.


# **Stakeholders’ Needs** 


| Stakeholder | Current issues/problems | Benefits | Measured by |
|--|--|--|--|
| Chief Sustainability Officer | Not all fishing practices are sustainable and a lot of the fishing is harmful to the environment. It is the chief sustainability officer’s job to create a harmless fishing process.  | There will be less harm associated with fishing which will create a safer environment.  | Toxins in the environment specifically around major fishing ports.  |
| Chief Prosecutor | Need data and evidence to be able to prosecute groups and individuals who are involved with illegal fishing activity.  | Amount of illegal fishing will decrease and people who are already involved in illegal fishing will be prosecuted.  | Measured by the ratio of illegal fishing that is caught and prosecuted to previous years. |
| Joint Venture Data Analyst | It is hard to gather data and find patterns without easy access to real-time data and imagery.  | The data analyst would be able to find certain patterns which can lead to the prosecution of illegal fishing activity.  | Measured by the frequency of when patterns are found to identify illegal fishing activity. |
| Joint Venture Data Engineer | The product they are currently trying to build, needs to be more scalable, secure, and reliable. | Creating a product that can easily analyze large amounts of data that can also be used by many firms and is known to be reliable will create a smoother system for data analysis and evidence collection.  | Measured by the easiness and efficiency of using the new product to analyze data.  |
| Chief Executive Officer of Joint Venture Satellite Image Company  | There is no efficient way to collect satellite imagery and make it as clear and useful as possible.  | Clear and precise imagery can speed up the process of identifying and prosecuting illegal activity related to fishing.  | Clarity and frequency of new satellite images. |

# **Project Benefits**

The anticipated benefits include enhanced monitoring capabilities, real-time information breakdowns to stakeholders, and prompt action against detected illegal fishing activities. By aligning with the objectives of marine conservation, the project seeks to provide visible metrics, such as a reduction in IUU fishing incidents and increased compliance rates, to show its positive impact on the sustainability of marine resources in the long run. 

Furthermore, the project aims to enhance organizational efficiency, increase customer satisfaction, and potentially boost revenue. The system's features, including robust security measures, user-friendly interfaces, and comprehensive reporting options, are geared towards achieving these objectives. The comprehensive reporting options and real-time data visualization, integrated with analytics tools, not only enhance organizational efficiency but also offer valuable insights for informed decision-making. Most importantly, it will be extremely beneficial for prosecutors when gathering data. Through these strategic measures, the project aspires to quantifiably demonstrate a positive return on investment and deliver substantial benefits to stakeholders and users.


# **Risks**

There are numerous risks that the tracking and reporting system might face in its development, and we must find ways to mitigate these risks to ensure the success of the system. 

## Unauthorized Access to Data

One of the most critical risks is unauthorized access to sensitive data. Adversaries, including those who participate in illegal fishing activities, hackers, and other criminals, could gain access to the system and manipulate or steal the data to not get caught and prosecuted. The consequences of not prioritizing data security will be catastrophic for the system and the stakeholders, so it is the duty of the data engineer and JV System Admin to implement advanced encryption and access controls that are compliant with data laws and regulations so that the data remains secure and protected. 

## Waste of Resources and Funding

Another potential risk in developing the tracking and reporting system is the waste of resources and funding that would go into it if stakeholders and other users cannot use the system effectively. The system will contain a lot of data from various sources (GPS, historical data, Excel spreadsheets) and could be confusing or overwhelming to use. To mitigate this risk, those in management must ensure that there are workshops and training sessions for those who aren't actively building the system to train them to effectively use and make the most out of it. The data engineer and system admin must also design the system in a way that is intuitive, user-friendly, and easy for staff to access and use data effectively. They could do this by allowing staff to test initial versions of the system as they develop it and get user feedback to meet the needs of staff and adapt the system based on these suggestions. 

## Difficult to Manage and Risk of Unsustainability

One related risk is that due to the scope and the scale of the data that the system will store, it will be challenging to manage the system and won't be sustainable for the environment. This would go against the values of the joint venture and wreak havoc on the environment, so the stakeholders, especially the Chief Sustainability Officer, JV System Admin, and Data Engineer, would need to work together and ensure that the equipment and methods of data collection are eco friendly and sustainable potentially with an audit system.


# **Assumptions**

One assumption that is expected by the stakeholder is data security. Any form of data that’s used to analyze, transfer, or manage, needs to be secure and prevents unauthorized users from accessing the data. The joint venture system administrator has explicitly told us that they take data security and confidentiality very seriously. Although our solution is not directly related to data security, it’s an implied condition that any sort of data that we use in our process is properly secured. 

Another assumption is that our solution is sustainable and environmentally friendly. Both the CEO and Joint Venture System Administrator have stated that their current practices adhere to green IT practices such as: optimizing energy consumption, using energy efficient hardware, promoting remote work to reduce carbon footprint for every employee, and investing in robust system maintenance and continuous improvement. It’s crucial that our own practices and solutions align with the main goal of promoting sustainable fishing methods and preventing illegal activity.
