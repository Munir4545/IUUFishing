The idea of stopping Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated (IUU) fishing through the development of an advanced tracking and monitoring system shows a unique opportunity to address critical issues affecting marine resources worldwide. The project's first objective focuses on enhancing the technological infrastructure. By implementing state-of-the-art data encryption protocols, multi-factor authentication, and ensuring compliance with industry security standards, the system aims to significantly reduce the risk of unauthorized access and enhance overall data security, aligning with international best practices.

The second objective centers around improving the user experience and adoption of the Illegal Fishing Tracking Information System. Through iterative improvements based on user feedback, the project aims to achieve a high user satisfaction rate and streamline onboarding processes, ensuring a seamless experience for stakeholders involved. Training sessions will further enhance user engagement, fostering increased utilization of the system among Chief Sustainability Officers, CEOs of satellite imagery providers, Chief Prosecutors, Data Analysts, Data Engineers, and System Administrators associated with the joint venture.

The third objective addresses the need to strengthen reporting capabilities, a crucial component in the fight against illegal fishing activities. By implementing real-time data visualization features and enabling flexible reporting options with integrated analytics tools, the system aims to significantly reduce the time taken to identify and respond to illegal fishing incidents. This improvement in reporting efficiency is expected to contribute to the bigger goal of providing prompt information to relevant authorities, facilitating quick action against IUU fishing.

Each key result within these objectives is measurable, offering a clear framework for assessing the project's progress. Achieving these objectives not only ensures the successful deployment of the tracking system but also positions the joint venture, Ocean Guardians United (OGU), as one of the leaders in leveraging technology to combat illegal fishing activities. As the project unfolds, these objectives will play a crucial role in realizing the system's potential to protect marine resources, promote sustainability, and show responsibility within the fishing industry.
