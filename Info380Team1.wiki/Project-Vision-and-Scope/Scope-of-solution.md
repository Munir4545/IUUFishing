## In Scope
The project includes the development of an IUU Fishing Tracking Information System, leveraging ship tracking data, satellite imagery, and automated drone surveillance to effectively monitor and go against illegal fishing activities within designated areas. It includes the implementation of advanced technological infrastructure, such as data encryption, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control, to enhance the security and integrity of the system. User experience improvements, reporting capabilities, and a data-sharing platform are integral components to promote collaboration among stakeholders. The project also ensures legal work with international and national laws on fisheries management and conservation, providing a foundation for combating illegal fishing within legal frameworks. Ongoing support and maintenance, including regular software updates, responsive technical support, customizable Service Level Agreements (SLAs), and training resources, are included to ensure the sustained effectiveness of the system.

## Out of Scope
The project does not extend to the physical implementation of surveillance devices, such as drones, focusing solely on the development and implementation of the information system. Legislative changes related to fisheries management are not within the project's scope, as it concentrates on technological solutions within existing legal frameworks. While the project adopts a targeted approach to go against illegal fishing in specific regions, global coverage is not part of the initial scope. Training programs included in the project are limited to local fishing communities and enforcement agencies, excluding broader educational initiatives. Direct management of fish stocks or fisheries is not within the project's scope either. Instead, it relies on data collection and analysis to identify illegal fishing practices. The system supports targeted workflow automation related to illegal fishing without aiming to replace all existing manual processes within the joint venture.
