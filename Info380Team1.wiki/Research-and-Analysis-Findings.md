**Major Interview Findings**

The Joint Ventureâ€™s aim in creating this tracking and reporting system is to reduce IUU fishing, not to make a profit. Both data engineers and analysts emphasize that the new system must be easily scalable and reliable, thus letting the system handle large amounts of data. Geospatial data is seen as an important feature in the system and should help track more illegal fishing. Data analysts require tools that handle, sort, and visualize data because the data must meet the prosecution's standard. The prosecutor also emphasized that the data preserves the chain of custody. Incorporating historical data is important so that we identify patterns and trends. Data security is important and we should incorporate encryption, as well as having role-based access.

**Affinity Diagrams**

Early on we used affinity diagrams to understand the key and organize recurring themes and main points each of our stakeholders said in the interview. Data security was a recurring theme, especially encryption and role-based access. Many Functionality themes came up like, cloud-based, data warehouse, ETL and data pipelines, data formats, etc. 

**Online Research**
	
When we did our research we found important points our system should be addressing. Large and scalable systems require robust backup and disaster recovery measures to stay resilient in cyberattacks, and environmental disasters (Williams, 2023). Horizontal scaling lets enterprises keep peak performance as well as high availability while with vertical scaling the machine will have downtime to scale it up (nOps, 2023). Having a disaster recovery backup is important as 94% of companies that suffer catastrophic data loss do not survive (Team, 2023).

**Modeling Users and Personas**
	
When we modeled the persona of a data analyst, we discovered the need for easily accessible historical data, which the historical data can be very useful to compare with current data. We also found out that data analysts need to have analytical tool integration like GIS tools data visualization, and Excel. Using our modeling we found out that there was a huge need for customizable reports for data analysts, where they can share the report with relevant stakeholders. Overall with our persona of a data analyst, there was an overall emphasis on easily accessible data, tool integration, and customizable reports.
