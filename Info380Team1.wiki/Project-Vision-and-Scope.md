## Executive Summary
Illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing (IUU) is a considerable threat to global food security because of its impact on the fishing industry, sustainable fishing practices, and ecosystem damage. It can cost coastal nations an estimated $10 billion to $25 billion annually. Ocean Guardians United, a nonprofit joint venture, seeks to develop and implement a system that utilizes ship-tracking data, satellite imagery, and drone surveillance to track and report IUU fishing. This project aims to integrate a secure, reliable, scalable cloud-based solution with existing tracking technology and data management systems.

The systemâ€™s features

- Enhance monitoring and reporting capabilities
- Provide historical and real-time data for analyzing patterns
- Include customizable reports and dashboards

These features will also facilitate collaboration between users to promptly build evidence and cases against perpetrators of illegal fishing activities. All stakeholders will work together to ensure that the system complies with data privacy and collection laws and that international and national regulations on fishery management and conservation are enforced. Users working with the data will ensure the system's infrastructure is sustainable, user-friendly, and robust to maintain data protection and security and promote user satisfaction and performance.

## Solution Vision
At the core of our solution, we aim to develop new software tools for OGU to analyze, collect, and transfer data to aid in their process of combating illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing.  There are many success metrics behind our solution, but the software will mainly build upon: data management/performance, evidence collection, and data security. The solution is similar to industry-leading technologies such as cloud-based infrastructure for the performance and management of data and utilizing geospatial technologies to gather more accurate information for data analysis.

These areas of improvement will significantly improve the experience for engineers, lawyers, business partners, and other staff with the common goal of reducing the time spent searching for illegal fishing actors and reporting them quicker. Our partnership with 3rd party organizations will allow us to develop the necessary software to accomplish these goals, such as using satellite imagery technologies.
